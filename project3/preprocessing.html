<h2>Different Ways of Implementing Preprocessing.</h2>
<h3>Client-side:</h3>
    <p>Is the process of writing code to instruct clients also known as programs connected to servers to do specific tasks.
       These instructions allow developers to create webpages that are visually appealing to users and efficient in application.
       Ensure that all elements of the script are interactable and effective in the users web browser. Also known as front-end developing</p>
<h3>Server-side:</h3>
    <p>This is the process of creating instructions to send and recieve information that the user does not see. This includes security,
       data storage, and features that are accessible for the user (customer) and the owners/workers of a business. Also back-end developers
       and engineers.</p>

<h2>How to implement LESS</h2>
<h3>L.E.S.S</h3>
    <p>LESS is an acronym that stands for Leaner Style Sheets. It is a "backwards-compitable language extension for CSS". It could also be viewed as the 
       JavaScript styling language. As the function are much like JavaScript, LESS is able to do math, change colors, combine styling to different classes and id's.</p>
       <ul>
            <li>Mixins: ("Mixing In") is mixing a rule-set into another rule-set. When using something like a class or id, and you have another class styling that you want to have
                the same styling as the previous class you simply need to drop the class name into the next one as so: 
            </li><br>
            <li>Variables: Allows you to control each individual elements styling.</li><br>
            <li>Functions: With LESS developers are able to utilize functions that allow different results depending on the functions conditions. Functions such as,
                if, boolean, strings, math, and multiple of different ones. What the main for purpose of all these functions is to change the initial content(s) (input) into new 
                content based off a varied of conditions.</li><br>
            <li>Operators: Are your mathmatical outouts, capable of operating with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. All while being capable of accounting for conversions
                and order of operations. Can operate on any number, color, or variable.</li><br>
            <li>Nested Variables: Is the ability of adding styling to a single element with multiple classes to add different styling.</li>
       </ul>
