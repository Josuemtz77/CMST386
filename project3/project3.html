    <h2>Why is the importance of 'Taget Audience' and 'Responsive Design'?</h2>
    <h3>Target Audience-</h3>
    <p>Understanding the purpose of target audience is very important because as the design you want to tailer your branding, 
        marketing, and design based of that audience. For example; if I am design a website for a locally owned gym in my city, 
        I want be to include a design that is visually appealing to the local people. Include features and layout for the adverage 
        age group of gym goers. The design needs to familiar and unique all at the same time. If the website or the app is over 
        complicated users will not be pleased with their experience. Normally the adverage age gym-goer will use an app on their phone
        the website on their phone. It is important to understanding this because without the proper media-query tag the website layout
        will not fit a phone display or other devices than just the desktop. That is what makes your website respnsives. Adjust layout size,
        background color, placement of content. A responsive design becomes more comlex or simple it could have a direct effect on your
        audience.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Languages included on the website: and are they easily accessible for user to change their prefference on the app or website.</li>
            <li>Desktop, tablet, and phone display: will the users more likely use a specific device to utilize your website/app.</li>
            <li>Visually appealing: Does the look of the website call more of the professional users or is it a light, easy, fun website to use.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Google Analytics-</h3>
    <p>Google analytics is a tool utilized by developers to understand user experience and interactions. Using developing tools such as Google analytics
        you are able to monitor many different features such as demographics, mobile, and behavior.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Demographics: shows a report of gender, age, and location. Understanding demographics is a key report to research into because it give developers
                a better picture of who exactly is using their website/app. Although developers may intented to target s specific group initially, but now they are
                they could either shift focus to a new target audience or maintain what they have and improve even more.</li>
            <li>Mobile: Shows the report of which device the users were using. A very imprtant feature because your website's reactivity based off devices could very
                well ruin the user experience if it is not compatible with each device display. </li>
            <li>Behavior: Shows a report how the user interacts with the website for understanding marketing purposes. It reveals how users make purchases if theres products,
                how they respond to certain articles, videos, and comments. These behavioral patterns in users tell the developer how they are able to build a better marketing
                and advertisement for their website.
            </li>
        </ol>
