    <h1>CMST 386: Search Engine Optimization</h1>
    <p>Throughtout this section we will discuss the topic of Search Engine Optimization, 
        other wise known as SEO. We will go over what SEO means in simple terms, how and why it is utilized and the main 
        purpose of ensuring whether your website is developed effeciently for SEO.</p>
    <h2>How Does Search Engine Optimization Work?</h2>
    <p>It is a system that processes all websites and content in Google's or other search engines indexes to display
        your content when a user searches it. In that moment a one of two actions take place; a crawler-based search
        a human-based search. A crawler-base search is when an automated system is used that consistantly "crawls" your
        content and stores everything it finds.</p>
    <h3>What does SEO mean?</h3>
    <p>Search Engine Optimization is the practice of developing a website on certain key factors that determines 
        the organization and structure also known as semantics. Following these key factors and maintaining 
        semantic organization gives you a rank based off effeciency and the quality of the development. The ranking system
        is a very complex system, but to help improve a website's rank a developer must consider these four basic factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Content of the page: Do you as the developer provide high quality website by implementing organization and 
            presentation to the user.</li><br>
        <li>Page Title: It should consist of a very brief headline explaining the page's content.</li><br>
        <li>Meta Description: Gives a descriptive tag to allow Google and other search engines to summarize what your page is about.</li><br>
        <li>Meta Keywords: Use distinct, specific keywords in the description to help Google and other search engines to catagorize your content.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Importance of Keywords and Descriptions:</h3>
    <p>As discussed in the section above 'Whats does SEO mean?', the importance of labeling accurate meta key words and descriptions allows search 
       engines understand and catagorize/store key information about your in the index query as referred as the search bank. It gives information
       about the page as user search the internet to find content that fit their needs. Understanding your webpage
    </p>
    <h3>Four Elements that comprise writing content relanvent links:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You are what you E.A.T (exper, authoritive, and trustworthy).</li>
        <li>Users Intent with the links</li>
        <li>Anchor text to help search engines catagorize your page with connecting links.</li>
        <li>Following principles and practices to stay away from spammy links.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What Constitutes a Good Hierarchy?</h3>
    <p>To build good Hierarchy is like following a recipe. You wouldn't place the tomato, then bread, and the turkey. Developing proper Hierarchy
       is much like that, you wouldn't place a &lt;h2&gt; before an &lt;h1&gt;. Practicing good hierarchy creates a fluency in the meta world
       of development. As stated before it is through quality semantics that contributes to good hierarchy.</p>
    <p>example:</p>
    <p>&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;CMST 386 - Project1&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>
       &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;This is my website&lt;/h2&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
    <p>Notice how the example above provides a openning and closing tage for each respective tag. There is also a fluency and hierarchy of 
       the tags, from the opening decloration &#8594; openning HTML tag &#8594; openning Head tag &#8594; title tag including the closing tag with title name
       &#8594; closing Head tag &#8594; openning body tag &#8594; h1 heading &#8594; h2 heading &#8594; closing body tag &#8594; closing html tag.
